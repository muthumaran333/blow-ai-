```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration (Simple Explanation)

The `.env` file is where you customize settings. Think of it like a recipe that tells the system:

- **Which Google Gemini key to use** (for online mode)
- **Which local model to run** (for offline mode)
- **Which voice to use** for speaking responses
- **How to process audio** for best quality

We provide a template (`.env.example`) so you just copy it and add your settings.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### "My internet is off but AI still works!"
✅ Perfect! That's Ollama (offline mode) running. This is the feature working as designed.

### "I want better responses"
✅ Switch to Gemini by clicking the radio button. Better responses at the cost of needing internet.

### "The AI can't hear me"
Try this:
- Speak louder and clearer
- Reduce background noise
- Make sure browser has microphone permission
- Check computer volume isn't muted

### "Gemini says no more quota"
Google's free tier has limits. Solutions:
- Use Ollama instead (offline, no limits)
- Wait for free tier to reset
- Add a credit card to Google Cloud for unlimited

### "Something isn't working"
1. Check browser console (Press F12)
2. Look at terminal where server runs
3. Restart both frontend and backend
4. Check [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed help
